      Websites are a requirement for business in this day and age. Developers are required to make a website stand out. Majoring in Web Design and Development, I have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and database management. I can act as a steady point for my team to anchor to throughout our project, offering reliable support to my coworkers while bringing creative and intutive input to our work. As long as I am given a goal and the tools with which to accomplish it, I will work through what I have until a completed product stands ready to ship.</p>
