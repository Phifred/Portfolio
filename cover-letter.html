      <p>Dear Sir or Madam</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 3em">When I search for an opening for a web designer with a company, I feel confident in my ability to bring skill and finesse to a workspace. In my current position as a student with The University of Arkansas at Little Rock, I’ve improved my repertoire immensely over these four years. I’m sure I can use my expertise to bring valuable talent to your company.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 3em">In my current position as a student with The University of Arkansas at Little Rock, my key challenge has been growth. Here are some of my recent results:</p>
      <ul style="text-indent: 3em">
          <li>Created and launched multiple websites for both personal use and professional clients.</li>
          <li>Excelled in classes with a GPA consistently averaging between 3 and 4.</li>
          <li>Optimized my skill set, growing creatively and technically over 4 years.</li>
          <li>Led multiple teams of 3-4 to gain experience and knowledge in the field.</li>
          <li>I have made the Dean’s list 2 semesters in a row</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 3em">I know that your company is looking for talented individuals to elevate performance. It would be an exciting opportunity for me to use my skills and creativity developing for your company.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 3em">We can schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss my solutions for boosting your company’s productivity substantially in the next quarter.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Best regards,</p>
      <p>Phillip Fredieu</p>
