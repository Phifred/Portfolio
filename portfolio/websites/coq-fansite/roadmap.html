                    <li>
                        Factions and Reputation
                        <ul>
                            <li>To build out Qud&#8217;s vibrant ecosystem, we&#8217;ll add creature factions and faction relationships that dictate how each creature reacts to every other creature in the world. As a result of the faction system, each region&#8217;s
                                flora and fauna will have their own dynamic. For example, while trekking through the jungle you might stumble upon a chitinous puma stalking a herd of fork-horned gnu, or a goatfolk war party assailing a chrome idol and
                                its worshippers.</li>
                            <li>On top of the faction system, we&#8217;ll build a reputation system that represents your standing with each of Qud&#8217;s factions. You&#8217;ll be able to increase your faction by offering gifts and sharing water with faction
                                leaders. Conversely, slaying faction leaders will lower your reputation with their faction. If you&#8217;re able to sufficiently increase your reputation with a hostile faction, they&#8217;ll stop attacking you. And if
                                you gain enough favor, they&#8217;ll become friendly toward you, helping you in battle and welcoming you into their holy places.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Skill Refreshes
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll refresh many of Qud&#8217;s stale skills and powers, paying special attention to the character-shaping weapon skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Character Build Library
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add a character build library so that you can save, name, and share your favorite character builds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>World Seeds
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll refactor world generation and expose world seeds that&#8217;ll let you replay or share a specific world-instance of Qud.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Six Day Stilt
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deep in the northern flats of Moghra&#8217;yi, inside the husk of a petrified salt kraken, the Mechanimists are erecting a cathedral of unrivaled splendor. There, and throughout the surrounding Great Bazaar, more folks are
                                gathered than at any other location in Qud.</li>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add a new city, the Six Day Stilt, temple-home to the Mechanimists. There will be statues of the Argent Fathers, a hologram of Shekhinah, marble reliefs depicting the sacred events, a Mechanimist graveyard, and
                                a librarian collecting books for the cathedral library (in exchange for XP). Surrounding the cathedral will be the Stiltgrounds, a great merchant bazaar and gathering place with procedurally-generated merchant tents.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Procedurally-Generated Books
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qud is wild and untamed, but scholarship plays an important role in nurturing civilization back from the seeds of the past. There are already several handwritten books: parables, journals, sacred texts, historical accounts,
                                mathematical treatises, etc. We&#8217;ll add procedurally-generated books from across the ages of Qud (and beyond). Though they&#8217;ll be cryptic and only semi-decipherable, they&#8217;ll contain secrets that you can
                                act on in the game world.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mods &amp; Steam Workshop Support
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll make <em>Caves of Qud </em>moddable so you can add your own creatures, items, tiles, sounds, quests, and more. Then we&#8217;ll add Steam Workshop support so you can share your mods with the community or augment
                                Qud with other players&#8217; mods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Tinkerable Item Modifications
                        <ul>
                            <li>Right now the tinkering system lets you build items from schematics that you learn by accessing data disks. We&#8217;ll expand the system to let you learn the schematics for item modifications (e.g., &#8216;flaming&#8217;,
                                &#8216;scoped&#8217;, &#8216;spring-loaded&#8217;, etc) and mod your items.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Better Death Screen &amp; Chronologies
                        <ul>
                            <li>Death screens are a tradition in roguelikes. Because your characters are mortal, they serve as memorials by summarizing accomplishments, revealing unidentified items, and showcasing final moments. We&#8217;ll expand the <em>Caves of Qud</em>                                death screen and let you export it to a text file. We&#8217;ll also add a chronology that narrativizes the events of your character&#8217;s life.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Biomes
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qud is a hybrid handcrafted world with procedurally-generated details. We&#8217;ll add more variety to the handcrafted areas by introducing biomes, which&#8217;ll be overlaid onto the world map each game via a random noise
                                function. Biomes will alter an area&#8217;s flora and fauna.</li>
                            <li>For example, the slime biome will add scumgrass and slime pools to the area. If an area&#8217;s slime value exceeds a certain threshold, creatures populating that area will have a chance to spawn with webbed toes. If it exceeds
                                a further threshold, creatures will have a chance to spawn with the slime-spitting mutation. Types of biomes will include slimy, tarry, rusty, and fungus-infested. Each biome will be likely to harbor certain oddities and
                                treasures, such as tar-encrusted fossils.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fungal Infections
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qud is biologically rich. That richness goes beyond typical life to include diseases, parasites, and symbiotes. Diseases already exist in game, so we&#8217;ll be adding symbiotic fungal infections to complement them. You&#8217;ll
                                contract fungal infections on your various body parts, and they&#8217;ll act as unremovable pieces of equipment that each bestow some type of benefit and some type of hindrance. You&#8217;ll be able to cure them, but the
                                cures will be procedurally-generated, just like the cures for diseases.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Main Quest: The Earl of Omonporch
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll replace <em>Ripe for the Conflagrating</em> with a much more interesting quest, <em>The Earl of Omonporch</em>, that&#8217;ll hook into the new reputation system.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Main Quest: Pax Klanq, I Presume?
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add the next leg of the main quest, <em>Pax Klanq, I Presume?</em>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>New Areas: The Rainbow Wood
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add a new mid-game region to Qud, a prismatic fungal jungle that&#8217;s home to various kinds of mushrooms, liquid-weeping lichen, and a new liquid: primordial soup. Primordial soup can be catalyzed by other liquids
                                to produce soup sludges with abilities based on the liquids that formed them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Daily &amp; Weekly Challenges
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add daily and weekly challenge characters and world seeds. When your challenge character dies, your ranking for that day or week will appear on the death screen.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Steam Leaderboards
                        <ul>
                            <li>To share daily and weekly challenges results with the community, we&#8217;ll add support for Steam Leaderboards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Sultans of Qud: Part I
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qud is a layer cake of fallen civilizations. In his influential history book, &#8220;Frivolous Lives&#8221;, the Baccata Yewtarch explains how the past 1,000 years have been dominated by petty humanoid kings and interregna.
                                Before that was the Age of the Eaters, when the mysterious progenitors ruled from lofty spires now buried under shale. The lives of five great sultans have been preserved through cultural artifacts and oral tradition.</li>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add generated histories for the Five Great Sultans, and shrines, paintings, and engravings that reveal pieces of their histories. Additionally, we&#8217;ll add to the world map four generated historic sites whose
                                names, descriptions, contents, historical significance, and look &amp; feel are based on the generated histories. If any artifacts are created during history generation, we&#8217;ll place them in the game world. Looking
                                at shrines, painted items, and engraved items will occasionally give you procedurally-generated quests to visit historic sites or recover relics.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, historic sites will be populated by procedurally-generated cults that worship a particular sultan. These cults will be fully fleshed-out factions in the game world, meaning you can increase your reputation with
                                them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Journal, Observations, &amp; Secrets
                        <ul>
                            <li>As you play Caves of Qud, you accumulate a bounty of knowledge. We&#8217;ll add a journal that tracks your character&#8217;s chronology, historical snippets you learn about ancient sultans, and useful locations you discover.
                                You&#8217;ll be able to add your own notes to the journal and keep track of interesting places on the world map.</li>
                            <li>Moreover, observations you make and secrets you uncover will unlock access to hidden pieces of the world. These may take the form of bonus dialog choices or unrevealed locations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reputation Enhancements &amp; the Water Ritual
                        <ul>
                            <li>The reputation system lets you befriend any of Qud&#8217;s sixty plus factions by treating with or slaying faction leaders. We&#8217;ll expand the rewards for earning high reputation with a faction and give more cultural texture
                                to the Water Ritual, which is the practice of sharing precious fresh water with a faction leader to secure a bond with their kinfolk. When you engage in the Water Ritual with a faction leader, you&#8217;ll be able to spend
                                reputation to learn secrets, recruit the leader to your party, or gain other benefits.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>More Interesting True Kin
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are two playable genotypes in <em>Caves of Qud</em>: mutants and true kin. Both character types have advantages, but mutants get access to seventy+ mutations, allowing for near-infinite character variety and customization.
                                We&#8217;ll narrow the gap by making true kin more interesting. In particular, we&#8217;ll expand the cybernetics system that&#8217;s only available to true kin characters.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cooking and a Better Hunger System
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roguelikes have a tradition of using survival mechanics like hunger and thirst to egg the player onward. The cultural importance of water in Qud makes thirst an interesting mechanic, but our current hunger mechanic doesn&#8217;t
                                quite meet our standards. We&#8217;ll redesign the hunger system and add a procedurally-driven cooking system. Our goal is to evoke the unique cultural role food plays in civilization and how that role is manifested in
                                the strange and biodiverse world of Qud.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Generated Villages and Alternate Starts
                        <ul>
                            <li>Right now you begin every game of Qud in Joppa, a starting village with handcrafted architecture, history, customs, NPCs, and player quests. Joppa&#8217;s consistency helps new players acclimatize to the strange world of Qud,
                                both its unfamiliar, far-future setting and its hybrid handcrafted / generated approach to worldbuilding. But for veterans who&#8217;ve started dozens+ games of <em>Caves of Qud</em>, the opening can feel repetitive. So,
                                as an alternative to Joppa, we&#8217;ll be providing procedurally generated villages to start the game in. They&#8217;ll have their own generated quests that&#8217;ll take you through the early game and link you back up
                                to the trunk of the main quest. Or you can you use them as a launching point to explore the world on your own terms.</li>
                            <li>Though the main goal of generated villages is to increase variety in the early game, we&#8217;ll be adding these villages across all of Qud. Each village will have its own generated faction, history, architecture, relationship
                                with local resources, storytelling tradition, proverb, signature dish, signature skill, named &#038; unnamed NPCs, and quests. In sum, generated villages will be a culmination of all our generative work up until this point.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li>In addition to hundreds of generated locations, Qud is home to four meticulously handcrafted towns: the oasis village of Joppa, the cathedral and merchant bazaar at the Six Day Stilt, the subterranean tinker enclave Grit Gate,
                                and the mushroom dwellings of Kyakukya. We&#8217;ll add three to four more handcrafted towns across Qud, spanning the mid to late game. Each town will have its own NPCs, merchants, side quests, and particular oddities.
                                There will also be more talking plants.</li>

                            <li>Qud is a layer cake of fallen civilizations. In his influential history book, &#8220;Frivolous Lives&#8221;, the Baccata Yewtarch explains how the past 1,000 years have been dominated by petty humanoid kings and interregna.
                                Before that was the Age of the Eaters, when the mysterious progenitors ruled from lofty spires now buried under shale. The lives of five great sultans have been preserved through cultural artifacts and oral tradition.</li>
                            <li>In the first Sultans of Qud feature arc, we added generated histories for the Five Great Sultans, including historic sites, cults, relics, shrines, and artwork that told their stories. In Part II, we&#8217;ll add more mid-to-late
                                game historic sites and we&#8217;ll tie together the events of the sultans&#8217; lives so you can retrace their paths through Qud.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Two+ New Regions
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qud&#8217;s regions are diverse: salt marshes, desert canyons, flower fields, jungles, banana groves, fungal labyrinths, and chrome ruins. We&#8217;ll add at least two more regions designed for the late game, each with their
                                own flora, fauna, and special encounters.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Special Locations
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qud&#8217;s history books make note of all sorts of special locations, such as robot king K4K5&#8217;s monumental statue and Hegelrut&#8217;s tomb. We&#8217;ll add more of these to the world as explorable locations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Main Quest: The Tomb of the Eaters
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add the next leg of the main quest, tying in the sultans of Qud and their generated histories.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Main Quest: ?????
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add the penultimate leg of the main quest.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Main Quest: ?????
                        <ul>
                            <li>We&#8217;ll add the final leg of the main quest, including multiple endings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A Brand New UI
                        <ul>
                            <li>For a roguelike, our user interface is robust. But we&#8217;d like to bring <em>Caves of Qud</em> into the modern era of good RPG interface design. That&#8217;ll include full mouse and gamepad support, hotkeys for abilities,
                                a paper doll equipment screen, and much more. The traditional UI will remain available too.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Accessibility &amp; Tutorial
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Caves of Qud</em> is neutron-star-level dense. It&#8217;s a puzzle box that&#8217;s meant to be unlocked over time, but we don&#8217;t intend it to be unnecessarily obscure. So we&#8217;ll add a tutorial, basic documentation,
                                and accessibility improvements to get you quickly situated in the world and exploring.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Sound and Music
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our fantastic composers Craig Hamilton and Brandon Tanner will continue work on their atmospheric, original soundtrack for <em>Caves of Qud</em>. We&#8217;ll continue adding sound effects, too.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Steam Achievements
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expect a whole slew of achievements that encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of Qud. Examples: Slay a pentasludge. Become a goat. Wear your own severed face on your face.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Coloring in the Lines
                        <ul>
                            <li>For all the systems and features that already exist, we&#8217;ll continually add more content. That means new items, monsters, biomes, fungal infections, skill refreshes, tile art, sound effects, and more.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
