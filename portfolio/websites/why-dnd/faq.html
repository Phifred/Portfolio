              <h2>Wait, isn't D&D only played by basement-dwelling nerds?</h2>
              <p>This is completely false, a remnant of a relic stereotype of the time when people thought daycare centers were
              satanic and every person in America had a stick up their ass. D&D is enjoyed by people of all professions, hobbies,
              and demographics.</p>
              
              <h2>All of these rules are so confusing! Where am I even supposed to start?</h2>
              <p>It may seem daunting at first, but it's not as confusing as it seems. Just give rulebook a good read and if 
              you're ever unsure of something, look back and check on it in the book. Don't be afraid to ask your DM if you're unclear
              on something.</p>
              
              <h2>The PHB and SRD are nice and all, but is there anything else I can use to spice up my game?</h2>
              <p><img src=assets/img/5e-beholder.jpeg class="align-left" alt="A Beholder from D&D 5e"/>Absolutely! There's lots of additional supplemental reference 
              books published by Wizards of the Coast: Volo's Guide to Monsters, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, Mordenkainen's 
              Tome of Foes, and the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, just to name a few.
              In addition to this, you're not limited to the official tomes in what you can do in the game. If you're so inclined, you
              can make homebrew classes, races, monsters, etc. Everything in the game is subject to your whim.</p>
              
              <h2>Is there a way I can play D&D, but in a different setting?</h2>
              <p>Absolutely! There's a myriad of established tabletop RPG worlds, settings, genres, etc. From Star Wars to Lord of the Rings.
              If you can't find an already set-up incarnation of the game that fits what you're looking for, then get together with some 
              friends and make it yourself. Craft a completely homebrew world and characters then go and explore it.</p>
