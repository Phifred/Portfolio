              <h2>Okay, where do I start?</h2>
              <p><img src=assets/img/dice-box-1.jpeg class="align-right" alt="a box of dice"/>First thing's first: If you want to play D&D, you'll need a party.
              Get together a few friends who might be interested, and make sure you have someone that wants to be the Dungeon Master (DM).
              If you're the one getting other friends into the game, chances are that you'll probably end up being the DM, but if 
              you feel like you're not entirely up to the task of DM'ing, maybe you have a friend who's familiar with the game who 
              wouldn't mind DM'ing for you and your group. Secondly, you'll need the materials to play with. If you've got $20 to spare,
              visit your local game shop, or Amazon, and pick up a D&D starter kit. It comes with a rulebook, dice, character sheets, and even a
              basic campaign to help fledgling DMs figure out the ropes of guiding players through an adventure. If you're strapped for cash,
              don't worry, the internet has alternatives for you. The official D&D website has character sheet PDFs that you can download
              and print for free, and there's the Fifth Edition Source Reference Document. The 5e SRD is basically a lite version of the Player's Handbook:
              free for people to use and spread however they wish, but somewhat limited in what all it covers. It has all the basics
              for new players getting into the game to understand how D&D works, and is only lacking in some of the more flavorful
              parts of the game, like feats, backgrounds, subclasses, subraces, etc. It is definitely a go-to for people curious
              about the game, but not wishing to drop any money into it just to try it out.</p>
              
              <h2>Wait, AC? 3d6? What is all this gibberish?</h2>
              <p>The terminology is definitely something important that you should learn. First: the shorthand for dice. Dicerolls are 
              shorthanded by the number of rolls, followed by a "d", followed by the number of sides the die has. So, for example, if a 
              wizard casts a firebolt spell at a goblin, they make a ranged attack roll. For this, the wizard rolls a d20 against the goblins 
              AC, which is 15. If the roll comes out above the Goblin's AC, then the goblin takes 1d10 damage from this attack, which means 
              the wizard rolls one ten-sided die to determine how much damage they do. Now, AC is the Armor Class of a creature. It determines
              whether or not a creature takes damage depending on the attack roll of the aggressor. Going further into this, a goblin has 
              a CR of 1/4. CR stands for challenge rating, and is a measure of how tough a monster is, indicates how much experience a 
              character gets by killing it, and serves as a reference point for when a DM should throw that particular monster at a party.
              For example, a party of 10th level adventurers would probably get bored pretty quick if you just keep throwing wolves and goblins
              at them, both of which are monsters with a CR of 1/4. However, it would probably be prudent to not pit a party of 4th level 
              adventurers against an iron golem, which has a CR of 16. As a general rule of thumb, a well-equipped and well-rested party 
              should be able to handle a monster with a challenge rating equal to the average level of the party. So a prepared party of 3rd level
              adventurers should find a monster with a CR of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one. All of these topics and more are 
              covered in the reference material for the game.</p>
              
              <h2>Okay, I've got my party and my resources, now what?</h2>
              <p><img src=assets/img/gnome-wizard.jpeg class="align-left" alt="A gnome wizard"/>Now you create your characters and establish the world. Establishing 
              a world is the job of the DM, and the DM can choose to explore the official campaigns released by Wizards of the Coast, or build 
              their own world entirely. If a DM is building their own world, then they're probably experienced at this sort of thing. I wont go 
              into much detail here, most of it is covered in the rulebooks, and there's frankly a lot of explaining involved. For everyone that 
              isn't the DM, you make your characters. Most of this is also covered in the rulebook. The most important part of making characters is 
              choosing a class and setting up their skills. As for choosing a class, that is as simple as looking at the rulebook and figuring out 
              how you want to play. Skills, however, are a bit more complicated. Most DMs choose between three different methods for determining 
              skill values: rolling, point-spending, and standardized values. Rolling skills varies slightly from DM to DM, but the basic standard 
              is to roll 4d6 for each skill and drop the lowest rolled value for each skill. So, for example, you might roll a 4, 2, 5, and 3. 
              This would amount to a total of 12 (4+5+3, the 2 is not counted). Most of the time, DMs will also allow players 2 rerolls to attempt 
              a better score. For the second method, point spending, the DM specifies a number of points the players have, and the players are 
              allowed to put these points into their skills as they see fit. The final method, the Standard Array, takes away the luck and fine-tuning.
              It gives players set values (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) that they assign to their skills as they see fit. So, for example, a wizard 
              (or a smart one, at least) would set their intelligence to 15, their wisdom to 14, constitution to 13, dexterity to 12, their
              charisma to 10, and their strength to 8. </p>
              
              <h2>Okay, we've all made our characters, the world is set up, now what?</h2>
              <p>Now, all that's left is for you to play. To join the game. Go on an adventure. The DM sets up the world, and the party 
              bends it to their will. Visit a tavern to see if there's any rumors or quests to look into, head out into the wilderness
              and see what happens, break into a nobleman's house and see if there's any loot to be had. This is the part where you 
              simply let your imagination run amok. Let your creativity rule your actions.</p>
