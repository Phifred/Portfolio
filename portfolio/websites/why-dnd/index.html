              <h2>What even <em>is</em> Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
              <p><img src=assets/img/dice-box-2.jpeg class="align-right" alt="A box with dice"/>On the off chance that you may somehow not have heard 
              of it in some way, shape, or form, Dungeons and Dragons (most usually abbreviated to D&D) is a tabletop role playing 
              game in which players create characters, and go on an adventure with them with the help of a Dungeon Master, who 
              essentially creates the story for your characters to go through. It is a game that is only limited by one's imagination. 
              Cheesy, I know, but it's completely true.</p>
              
              <h2>Why, in an age of video games like Elder Scrolls, should you still consider playing a tabletop?</h2>
              <p>While at first it may seem that a tabletop RPG may be made obsolete by video games such as Skyrim and other
              similar titles, nothing could be further from the truth. These simulated open-worlds are impressive, there is 
              no denying that, but they have their limitations. They can only simulate events as far as their code allows them
              to. In D&D, however, there are no limits. You can have your character do anything you can think of.  For example: 
              in Skyrim, things like fire and spells are pretty much limited to the damage they can do and the physics effects 
              they can have on items. You can cast a firebolt, hit a basket, and while it might go flying (which is entertaining
              in its own right), that's about the end of it. In D&D, however, you can take that basket, fill it with vials of acid,
              light it on fire, and then throw it into a group of enemies and see what happens. This is only the most mundane 
              example of something you can have your character do. As previously stated, the only limit to your abilities is your
              imagination.</p>
              
              <h2>But what makes D&D actually fun?</h2>
              <p>At the very core of D&D lies something that many people gradually lose as they grow older. At the very root of the game,
              the very foundation it is built on, is your imagination. Your creativity.<img src=assets/img/dnd-dragon-symbol.jpg class="align-left" alt="The logo for D&D">
              A childlike wonderment that calls back to the days 
              when you'd pick up a stick off the ground and pretend it was a sword. It brings to life a feeling of whimsy, a feeling that
              is shared with everyone in your party. It is an effect compounded by the people you play the game with. You get invested
              in your character, you tell a story through their eyes, you shape your fantasy world as you see fit and you frolic in it.
              D&D evokes the very essence of a role playing game and brings it to life in the most amazing ways.</p>
              
              <h2>Wait, isn't D&D really complicated?</h2>
              <p>Nope! In fact, the latest incarnation of D&D, the Fifth Edition (commonly abbreviated as 5e), is considered the most
              user-friendly incarnation of the tabletop RPG genre. If you and your friends can read, you can play 5e. There's never been
              a better time to consider trying out tabletop RPGs.</p>
